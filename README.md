# Automated-data-backup-system
Automated data backup for Windows using PowerShell and Python.


This is a basic setup for initiating the backup process using PowerShell and calling a Python script (backup_script.py) to perform the actual backup operation. The Python script recursively copies files from the source directory to the destination directory.

You can enhance this code further by adding features such as scheduling backups, handling errors more gracefully, implementing compression and encryption, and providing more detailed logging.
